      <h1>Gabriel's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Gabriel Rodr√≠guez. Welcome to my portfolio.</p>

      <p>I am 21 years old. I live in Puerto Rico. I'm a computer engineering student at the Inter American University of Puerto Rico. A natural choice, given how much time I spent on the computer growing up. I've always been a total geek for all forms of entertainment, as well as for math and science. Over time, my enjoyment of the arts surpassed my enjoyment of the sciences, but I still love learning about what makes the world go round.</p>
      <p>If asked to talk about myself, my mind goes to the art that has influenced me over the years and made me who I am. Everything from watching Thomas the Tank Engine as a pre-schooler, to growing up with BIONICLE and Doctor Who, to becoming enamored with anime in my teens, has contributed to making me who I am. I won't go on for too long about my interests, but I'll drop a couple favorites:</p>
      <p>Favorite anime: Revolutionary Girl Utena</p>
      <p>Favorite live-action TV series: Doctor Who</p>
      <p>Favorite movie: Kill Bill</p>
      <p>Favorite video game: Portal 2</p>
      <p>Favorite visual novel: Fate/stay night</p>
      <p>Favorite years-spanning multimedia saga: BIONICLE</p>
      <p>Out of these, my most enduring love is probably for BIONICLE. Not because it's the highest quality of these, but because I have the most attachment to it. I'd spend hours upon hours browsing the BIONICLE wiki learning all there was to learn about its strangely compelling world.</p>

      <p>I'm also a huge anime nerd. There's a lot of notable and popular series that I'm still yet to get around to, but in my relatively short time as a viewer, I've seen a decent chunk of anime from different years, different genres, different productions, etc. <a href="images.html">Here's</a> an album of anime I like.</p>
