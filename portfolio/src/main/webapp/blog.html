      <p>Here's some quick synopses for the five anime I displayed in the images page:</p>
      <p>Revolutionary Girl Utena - A kaleidoscopic rock opera of love, revolution, and progressivism. A must-see for anyone who cares about social issues such as gender identity and LGBTQ+ themes. It can be a difficult viewing due to its realistic portrayal of real dangers in the world, but it will never get too bogged in darkness. It has everything from gut-wrenching character drama to gut-busting comedic setpieces. My favorite things from the show are Ikuhara Kunihiko's directing prowess as honed in his time working on Sailor Moon, Kobayashi Shichiro's art design, and the music. The classical-sounding incidental music, but especially the vocal tracks written by JA Saezer that play during Utena's duels. I listen to them all the time... like right now! If this piqued your curiosity, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyPv7QyuZl0">have a look at the opening theme.</a></p>
      <p>K-On - Light music, or karui ongaku in Japanese, is a type of pop music that's supposed to be relatively easy to play. K-On follows the Light Music Club of Sakuragaoka High School as they traverse high school and all its ups and downs. What is often considered the peak of "cute" anime, K-On was produced by one of the greatest studios in the business, Kyoto Animation, and helmed by some of their best talent. K-On is a great time. Few shows make me cry the way this one does whenever I rewatch the final episodes or the movie.</p>
      <p>Princess Tutu - A beautiful tale of love, self-realization, and metanarrative. What happens when an author loses control of his stories? What happens when the characters in those stories begrudge their pre-written destinies? Princess Tutu addresses these questions as we follow Duck in her quest to save Prince Mytho as the fabled Princess Tutu.</p>
      <p>Neon Genesis Evangelion - One of the most famous love-it-or-hate-it shows, its placement here means I very squarely side with the "love it" camp. One of anime's game-changers, one of the greatest tales of discovering the value of self-importance in an unkind and uncaring world. Nothing I could say could make this show justice. Everything from the writing to Anno Hideaki's directing is stupendous. Nothing exists quite like this show.</p>
      <p>Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu - The most recent anime on this list, having aired in 2016. Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu tells a gripping character drama spanning decades of its characters' lives. Their ambitions as performers of Rakugo, a Japanese form of theatrical oratory, and everything they have to sacrifice to become masters of their craft. Out of the shows on this list, this one resembles the format of an award-winning mainstream piece of cinema the most. Its first episode is a feature length masterpiece that sets up the various characters we'll be seeing along the show's run. For anyone who wants anime's answer to films like Barry Lyndon, this is the show for you.</p>
